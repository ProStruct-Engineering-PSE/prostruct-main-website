This helps us <strong>determine</strong> the <strong>appropriate sizes and shapes</strong> of the structural members like beams, columns, load-bearing walls, and foundations <strong>for safety</strong>.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"str4\" class=\"str_sec\">\r\n<h4>Structural Plans</h4>\r\nBased on structural load calculation results, our structural engineers can <strong>develop plans for</strong> your home’s structural components, such as <strong>framing, foundation, and roof systems.</strong>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"str5\" class=\"str_sec\">\r\n<h4>Structural Permit Sets</h4>\r\nThese typically include detailed drawings and specifications of your home’s structural components, as well as calculations and other <strong>documentation</strong> required by local building departments <strong>to obtain a construction permit.</strong>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"str6\" class=\"str_sec\">\r\n<h4>Construction Administration</h4>\r\nOur professional structural engineers can provide Construction Administration services, which include guidance and advice throughout the construction process. This encompasses responding to <strong>Request for Information (RFI)</strong> , performing <strong>Submittal Reviews</strong>, addressing <strong>Substitution Requests</strong>, and conducting <strong>Structural Observations</strong> . Our structural engineers will inspect the construction work to ensure that your home is built to meet all relevant building codes and regulations as per the approved structural plans.
